# hw08-seed

Welcome to my repo for hw08:)

[Link to the online app](https://yukirang.shinyapps.io/bcl-08/)

The changes I've made for this app are:

* Add an image of the BC Liquor Store to the UI above everything.

* Use the DT package to turn the results table into an interactive one.

* Allow the user to download the results table as a ..csv file.(You can find a download button on top of the table.)

* Allow the user to search for multiple alcohol types simultaneously, instead of being able to choose only wines/beers/etc. (Now you can select several types in a checkbox.)

You might also want to check:

[app.R](bcl/app.R)


The code and data are from [Dean Attali's tutorial](https://deanattali.com/blog/building-shiny-apps-tutorial). The code can specifically be found [here](https://deanattali.com/blog/building-shiny-apps-tutorial/#12-final-shiny-app-code).

Good day!
